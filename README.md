* Developed a system with the help of Facial Recognition algorithms and synchronization of the cameras for checking the availability of professors inside the department
* Implemented models using principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), Inception Network
* Challenge was to develop a synchronized system as there are multiple gates in the department
* Created a setup using LEDs and Arduino which displays the name of the professor and their availability in the department
* Stored the in-time and out-time of the professors in a database that is further analyzed
* Language: Python, Database: MongoDB
